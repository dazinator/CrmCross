1. Create a CRM Online Free Trial: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics/crm-free-trial-overview.aspx
2. Go to Azure Management Portal - you need to log in with an account that has an Azure Subscription: https://manage.windowsazure.com/
3. Go to AD
4. Create a new AD directory - CUSTOM CREATE - use existing --> it should ask you to sign out and sign back in with your crm office 365 account that you created during the CRM trial sign up process.
5. It will tell you its created the directory - sign out from the office 365 account, and sign back in with your azure subscription account.
6. Go to the new AD directory (on azure management portal), on "Applications" - add a new "Native Client" application.
	Name: Your android app name - e.g CrmCross.Droid
	RedirectUrl: appSchema://CrmCross.Droid

After adding the native client app, expand the "Update your code" section to get the CLIENT ID - which is a GUID - e.g: d69a4eb7-ace3-4d62-888e-0259d4d792a7

7. Go to the permissions tab, and give the client app permission to Dynamics CRM Org (Add application - pick Dynamics Crm); (and access as crm organisation users)

8. Find TestConfig.cs in the CrmCross.PortableTests project, and update the following properties:

NativeClientId = your CLIENT ID
DroidNativeClientRedirectUrl = your RedirectUrl
Crm_2013_Online_Org_Url =  the url of your CRM organisation (that you created through the trial sign up)
Username = The username of an AD user account in your AD directory - you can see the users for the AD directory in the Azure Management Portal

9. Write the password for the above AD account in a plain txt file "crmcrosspassword.txt" and push this file to your android device:

adb push "crmcrosspassword.txt" "/mnt/sdcard/crmcrosspassword.txt"

The tests will read the password from this file when they run. This password should never be checked in to source control or specified in code anywhere.

10. You can now run the android tests.
