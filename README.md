# A Cross Platform Dynamics Crm SDK.

[This NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CrmCross/) is a portable implementation of the Dynamics CRM SDK, allowing you to use the Organisation Service from the following projects:

1. Xamarin Android (MonoTouch)
2. Xamarin iOS (Coming Soon)
3. Windows Phone (Coming Soon)

This project arose from some sample code that Microsoft provided [here](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Mobile-Development-Helper-3213e2e6/view/SourceCode#content). I have extended by adding in an ADAL token provider, and first class support for MonoDroid.
