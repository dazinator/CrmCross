# A Portable implementation of the Dynamics CRM SDK

[This NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CrmCross/) allows you to Authenticate with, and use the Dynamics CRM Organisation Service from your Xamarin projects!

To Get Started on Android (Xamarin), see here: https://bitbucket.org/dazinator/crmcross/wiki/Usage%20within%20Xamarin%20Android%20Projects

I have currently only added Android, as iOS requires a MAC for me to build the code - if you can help with that let me know!

After you add the NuGet package, see the wiki for details and examples of how to use the library.

This project arose from some sample code that Microsoft provided [here](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Mobile-Development-Helper-3213e2e6/view/SourceCode#content). I have extended by adding in an ADAL token provider, and first class support for MonoDroid.
