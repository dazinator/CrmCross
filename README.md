# Portable Dynamics CRM SDK

The goal is to have a full implementation of the Dynamics CRM SDK - as a portable class library. This will make it easy to build cross platform applications using tools like xamarin for example.
Microsoft have provided some "starting" code [here](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Mobile-Development-Helper-3213e2e6/view/SourceCode#content) - so I took this code, and the plan is to "carry it on" to make it more fully featured and mature.
